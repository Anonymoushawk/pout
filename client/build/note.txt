This program uses UPX to compress the size of the build file.

If you don't trust the binary source of UPX (upx.exe), you can download it directly from the UPX GitHub page:
https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest


The UPX binary is required if the 'compress' option is toggled in the client builder.
So just make sure that there is a valid UPX executable in this folder, or it will not be able to compress.
